                - `TreeMap`: Implements `NavigableMap` and `SortedMap`. Provides a red-black tree-based implementation that maintains a sorted order.
        - `HashMap`: Implements `Map`. Provides a hash table-based implementation. It does not maintain any order.
            - `LinkedHashMap`: Extends `HashMap` and maintains insertion order or access order.
        - `WeakHashMap`: Implements `Map`. Provides a hash table-based implementation with weak keys, which allows keys to be garbage-collected when no longer in use.

(Updates made in Version 2): 

- Make accessing certain elements faster (Faster Hashing Algorithm)
    - For Hashing Collision See if you can implement a faster Method (Using a tree)
- Implementing New Data Structures Like Graphs, and Trees (Heap, Red Black Tree, and Binary Search Tree)
- Implement new Sorting Algorithms inside the Collections class to allow users with a wide variety of options.
